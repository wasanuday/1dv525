                           <h2>   Why is it important to seperate the layout and design (css) from content (html)?</h2>
                             <p>Separating content from style is useful to avoid code duplication. If two elements share the same style, you shouldn't be writing the style twice; you should define it once and then reuse it. Writing it twice leads to maintenance problems which are too obvious to explain.</p>

                               <p>The Robots Exclusion Standard was developed in 1994 so that website owners can advise search engines how to crawl your website. The main difference being that the robots.txt file will stop search engines from seeing a page or directory, whereas the robots meta tag only controls whether it is indexed.</p>

                               <p>It's an initiative for knowing the people behind a website. It's a TXT file that contains information about the different people who have contributed to building the website.</p>

                           <p>The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook.To turn your web pages into graph objects, you need to add basic metadata to your page. We've based the initial version of the protocol on RDFa which means that you'll place additional meta tags in the head of your web page</p>
